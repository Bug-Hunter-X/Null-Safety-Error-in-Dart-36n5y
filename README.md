This repository demonstrates a common null safety issue in Dart and provides a solution.

The `bug.dart` file contains code that attempts to access a potentially null variable without proper null checks, leading to a runtime error. The `bugSolution.dart` file presents a corrected version with robust null handling.

The issue is that when dealing with nullable variables (denoted by ?), accessing them directly without checking can result in unexpected null pointer exceptions. The solution involves using either the null-aware operator (`??`) or checking for null before using the variable.
